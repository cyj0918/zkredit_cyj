[PLACEHOLDER BINARY FILE - CREDIT HISTORY VERIFIER R1CS]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the compiled R1CS constraint system
for the credit history verifier circuit. In a real compilation:
- Generated by: circom credit_history_verifier.circom --r1cs --wasm
- Contains constraint system for proving credit score ranges without revealing exact scores
- Used by snarkjs for trusted setup ceremony and proof verification
- Optimized for privacy-preserving credit assessment with 200+ constraints

Note: This represents actual binary compilation output needed for production ZK proofs.
