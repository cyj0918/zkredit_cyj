[PLACEHOLDER ZKEY FILE - INCOME VERIFIER FINAL PROVING KEY]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the final proving key (zkey) 
for the income verifier circuit. In actual deployment:
- Generated by: snarkjs zkey contribute after trusted setup ceremony
- Binary zkey format with encrypted proving parameters for income range proofs
- Used by prover to generate zero-knowledge proofs showing income falls within required range
- Contains circuit-specific proving parameters for privacy-preserving income validation
- Required for client-side proof generation in ZKudit system for salary verification

This file would typically be 100KB-800KB+ depending on the income verification circuit complexity
and number of constraints for range validation proof generation.

Note: This placeholder represents the actual zkey file needed for production 
generation of zero-knowledge proofs about income ranges without revealing exact salary amounts.
