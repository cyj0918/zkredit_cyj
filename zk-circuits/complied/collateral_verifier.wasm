[PLACEHOLDER WASM FILE - COLLATERAL VERIFIER WITNESS GENERATOR]  
This is a placeholder WebAssembly file representing the compiled witness generator
for the collateral verifier circuit. In actual compilation:
- Generated by: circom collateral_verifier.circom --wasm --sym
- Contains optimized WebAssembly code for witness computation
- Enables client-side proof generation without revealing collateral details
- Supports 7-factor collateral analysis including ratios, age, ownership, and risk assessment
- File size typically 80-250KB depending on optimization level and constraint complexity

This WASM module provides:
- Efficient witness generation for collateral verification proofs
- Memory-safe execution in web browsers and Node.js applications  
- Integration with ZKredit's client-side proof generation workflow
- Privacy-preserving validation of complex financial criteria

Note: This placeholder represents the actual WebAssembly compilation output needed for production use of collateral verification in the ZKudit system.
