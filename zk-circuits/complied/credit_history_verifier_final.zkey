[PLACEHOLDER ZKEY FILE - CREDIT HISTORY VERIFIER FINAL PROVING KEY]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the final proving key (zkey) 
for the credit history verifier circuit. In actual deployment:
- Generated by: snarkjs zkey contribute after trusted setup ceremony
- Binary zkey format with encrypted proving parameters for credit score proofs
- Used by prover to generate zero-knowledge proofs showing credit score ranges
- Contains circuit-specific proving parameters for financial privacy
- Required for client-side proof generation in ZKudit system

This file would typically be 150KB-1MB+ depending on the credit verification circuit complexity
and number of constraints for range proofs and validation checks.

Note: This placeholder represents the actual zkey file needed for production 
generation of zero-knowledge proofs about credit history without revealing specific scores.
