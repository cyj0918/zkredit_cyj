[PLACEHOLDER BINARY FILE - INCOME VERIFIER CIRCUIT CONSTRAINT SYSTEM]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the compiled R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) 
for the income verifier circuit. In a real compilation:
- This file would be generated by running: circom income_verifier.circom --r1cs --wasm
- It would contain the constraint system binary data used for proof verification
- File size would typically be 15-50KB for a circuit of this complexity
- Used as input for snarkjs for trusted setup ceremony and proof generation

Note: This placeholder represents the actual binary compilation output that would be required
for production use of the ZK circuit.
