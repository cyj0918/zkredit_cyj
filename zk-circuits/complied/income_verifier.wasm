[PLACEHOLDER WEBASSEMBLY FILE - INCOME VERIFIER CIRCUIT WITNESS GENERATOR]
This is a placeholder WebAssembly file representing the compiled witness generator 
for the income verifier circuit. In a real compilation:
- This file would be generated by running: circom income_verifier.circom --wasm
- It would contain the binary WebAssembly code for witness generation
- File size would typically be 40-150KB depending on circuit complexity
- Used directly in client-side or server-side applications for generating proofs
- Enables efficient computation of witness values from input data

Note: This placeholder represents the actual WASM compilation output required
for production use of the ZK circuit for proof generation.
