[PLACEHOLDER ZKEY FILE - COLLATERAL VERIFIER FINAL PROVING KEY]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the final proving key (zkey) 
for the collateral verifier circuit. In actual deployment:
- Generated by: snarkjs zkey contribute or trusted setup ceremony
- Binary zkey format specific to snarkjs with encrypted proving parameters
- Used by the prover to generate zero-knowledge proofs without trusted setup
- Contains circuit-specific proving parameters after ceremony completion
- Required for client-side proof generation in the ZKudit system

This file would typically be 200KB-2MB+ depending on circuit complexity and parameter count.
Note: This placeholder represents the actual zkey file needed for production proof generation.
