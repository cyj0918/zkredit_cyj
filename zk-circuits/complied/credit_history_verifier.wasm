[PLACEHOLDER WEBASSEMBLY FILE - CREDIT HISTORY VERIFIER WITNESS GENERATOR]
This is a placeholder WebAssembly file for the credit history verifier circuit.
In a real compilation, this would be generated by: circom credit_history_verifier.circom --wasm

This WASM module enables:
- Client-side witness generation for credit score range proofs
- Privacy-preserving proof creation without revealing exact credit scores
- Efficient computation in web browsers or Node.js applications
- Integration with the ZKudit frontend for credit assessments

File would typically be 60-200KB depending on circuit complexity and optimization.
