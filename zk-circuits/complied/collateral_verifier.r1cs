[PLACEHOLDER R1CS FILE - COLLATERAL VERIFIER CONSTRAINT SYSTEM]
This is a placeholder binary file representing the R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) 
for the collateral verifier circuit. In a real compilation:
- Generated by: circom collateral_verifier.circom --r1cs --wasm
- Contains approximately 300-800 constraints for comprehensive collateral validation
- Includes constraints for ratio verification, age validation, ownership checks, and risk analysis
- Used by snarkjs for trusted setup ceremony and proof generation
- Optimized for privacy-preserving collateral assessment with minimal constraint count

This file would typically be 25-80KB and contains the constraint system matrix defining 
the arithmetic relations needed for zero-knowledge proof generation of collateral validity.

Note: This placeholder represents the actual R1CS compilation output needed for production zkSNARK proofs.
